# ZTP_AAP_RHSS
Demo for provisioning RHEL 9 servers with Ansible Automation Platform and Red 
Hat Satellite Server.

If I've written this correctly, it will populate the Satellite server with the
MAC address, IP address, and hostname, and set up the kickstart so when the 
machine boots, it will kickstart and register correctly.
